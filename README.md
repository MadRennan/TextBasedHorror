# DarknessRPG {An Text Based Horror Game}

Obs: Darkness it's not the definitive name of this game, I don't know what to name it.

This is a text based horror game that I'm making for now. It isn't so optimized since I use so much if/elif/else statements.

This little terminal horror game is only available as PT/BR for now, I'm planning to make an English and Spanish version of it, where you can choose at the menu.

As I'll finish the second phase, I'll make an short menu.

I'll make an exe as soon as it reaches the V1.
